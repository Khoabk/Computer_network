Transport layer:
Terminologies:
Demultiplexing => The job of delivering the data in a transport-layer segment to the correct socket.
Requirements:
1.The sockets have unique identifiers.
2.Each segment have special fields that indicate the socket to which the segment is to be delivered. These special fields are the source port number and the destination port number.
Port number is a 16-bit number, ranging from 0 to 65535, port numbers ranging from 0 to 1023 are called well-known port numbers.
Overall procedure:
Each socket in the host could be assigned a port number, and when a segment arrives at the host, the transport layer examines the destination port number in the segment and directs the segment into the attached process.


Multiplexing => The job of gathering data chunks with header information (that will later be used in demultiplexing) to create segments, and passing the segments to the network layer.

UDP socket is fully identified by a two-tuple consisting of a destination IP address and a destination port number.

TCP socket is identified by a four tuple: (source IP address, source port number, destination IP address, destination port number).
